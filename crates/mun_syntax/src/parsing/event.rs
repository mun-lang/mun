//! It is intended to be completely decoupled from the parser, so as to allow to evolve the tree
//! representation and the parser algorithm independently.
//!
//! The `TreeSink` trait is the bridge between the parser and the tree builder: the parses
//! produces a stream of events like `start node`, `finish node` and `TreeSink` converts
//! this stream to a real tree.
