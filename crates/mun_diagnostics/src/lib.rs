//! This crate provides in-depth human-readable diagnostic information and fixes
//! for compiler errors that can be shared between the compiler and the language
//! server.
//!
//! The processing of diagnostics into human-readable is separated from the
//! machine-readable diagnostics in for instance the HIR crate for performance
//! reasons. This enables lazily querying the system for more information only
//! when required.
